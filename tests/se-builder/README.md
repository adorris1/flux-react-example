# Selenium Builder Stuff

This folder contains artifacts from SeBuilder. Currently unused, just here temporarily for reference and sharing.
Trying out SeBuilder to quickly generate some tests using a local version of the site.

## Folder Contents
The folder contains the following:
* js files
  * These are all the reasonable JS export options from the tool.
* json file
  * This is the SeBuilder project file.

## Problems
1. Hard coded baseUrl throughout.
2. Did not see options for generating promise based outcomes. Using chai as promised sure looks nicer, and probably easier to understand - for anyone (any role).
